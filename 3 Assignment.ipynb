    "Bagging aims to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning algorithms.

    "Let us understand this with help of an example. We have a training dataset with 1000 records. To make predictions we have taken random subsets of data from the training dataset and then used different ML models to train these subsets of data. These ML models are based on type of data (i.e. classifier for classification data and regressor for regression data). Note that the subsets will obviously be smaller than the training dataset. These models are called base learners and they are trained parallelly. The output of each model then aggregated either through voting for classification (the category with highest vote becomes prediction for new data) or through averaging for regression (the average value will be the prediction for new data).\n"
