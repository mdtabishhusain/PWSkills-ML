    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method in which we form clusters or groups of the data points of a dataset when plotted on graph. In unsupervised machine learning we don’t have any specific output. Based on input features we try to create clusters which contains similar kind of data. For example here shown in the graph is a dataset containing salary and expenditure of different individuals. There are 4 clusters forming, each specifying the income and expenditure of their class. Using these clusters a shopkeeper can decide how much discount he should give to people belonging to specific cluster. That is how clustering is helpful in solving business problems.\n",

    "K means clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm and it is also a type of clustering algorithm. As we already know in clustering algorithm we make clusters of data points so we now understand how K Means helps in making clusters of data. We will understand this with help of an example, we have a dataset with 2 features f_1 and f_2, we will mark the data points of these features on a graph and will be using the following steps for clustering the data points:\n",
    "\tFirst of all we will initialize some value for K. Here K is nothing but centroids for the clusters. Let us take K = 2. That means we will have 2 centroids. Now after initializing we will mark these K values on the graph at a random spot.\n",
    "\tNow we will make clusters or groups of the data points near the centroids. To make it easy we will draw straight line between the centroids and then draw a central perpendicular on this line (as shown in graph) so that we get 2 half and it becomes easy to classify which points will line near which centroid.\n",
    "\tAfter that as we can see in the graph there are 2 clusters forming one in orange and other in yellow. Now we will find mean of both the clusters individually and then move their centroids towards the mean.\n",
    "\tAfter moving we get a new centroid. Now again we will repeat the step using the new centroid and make new clusters of data points. Here we will see some data points of yellow clusters moved in range of orange cluster and vice versa.\n",
    "\tNow we will repeat the third step again and find the mean of the data points of each cluster and move the centroid toward the mean. After moving we will get the new centroids here as well. If there is still movement in data points from one cluster to another, then we will repeat the second and third step simultaneously again and again until there is no movement of data points from one cluster to another.\n",
    "\tOnce the movement between the data points from one cluster to another stops, we get a clean, grouped cluster of data points which will be the final clusters.\n"
